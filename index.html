            I wanna get off, but I keep riding the ride
            I never really noticed that I had to decide
            To play someone's game, or live my own life
            And now I do
            I wanna move
            Out of the black (out of the black)
            Into the blue (into the blue),<br> Finally
            Gone is the burden of the Crowley way of being
            That comes from energies combined
            Like my part was I
            Was not discerning
            And you, as we found out
            Were not in your right mind."</div>

            Even now, when we're already over
            I can't help myself from lookin' for you,I set fire to the rain
            Watched it pour as I touched your face
            Well, it burned while I cried
            'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
            Your name
            I set fire to the rain
            And I threw us into the flames
            When we fell, somethin' died
            'Cause I knew that that was the last time
            The last time."

        <div class="inner">"No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
            Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
            I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
            I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
            But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
            Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
            All the pain inside amplified by the
            Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
            Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
            'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
            And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
            And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
            Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
            Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
            Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
            Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
            To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
            To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
            Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
            Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
            To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
            So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
            This may be the only opportunity that I got."</div>

            Make a single sound
            Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
            Afraid I never before
            I didn't wanna go another round
            An angry man's power will shut you up
            Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
            Run out of excuses with every word
            So here I am and I will not run
            Guts over fear, (The time is here)
            Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)
            For all the times I let you push me around
            And let you keep me down
            (Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear
            Feels like a close, it's coming to
            Fuck am I gonna do?
            It's too late to start over
            This is the only thing I, thing I know,I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
            Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
            And the pain spawns all the anger on
            But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
            That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
            Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
            And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
            Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"."

        <div class="inner">"From the dusty mesa
            Her looming shadow grows
            Hidden in the branches of the poison creosote
            She twines her spines up slowly
            Towards the boiling sun
            And when I touched her skin
            My fingers ran with blood <br>
            In the hushing dusk under a swollen silver moon
            I came walking with the wind to watch the cactus bloom
            And strange hands halted me, the looming shadows danced
            I fell down to the thorny brush and felt the trembling hands <br>
            When the last light warms the rocks
            And the rattlesnakes unfold
            Mountain cats will come to drag away your bones <br>
            And rise with me forever
            Across the silent sand
            And the stars will be your eyes
            And the wind will be my hands."

            The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
            Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?
            These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
            Wishing you were around but now it's too late
            My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
            Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
            One more rainy day without you
            Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day

            Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
